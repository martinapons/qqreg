\usage{
detect_var_types(formula, data, group)
}
\arguments{
\item{formula}{A formula specifying the model.}

\item{data}{A data frame containing the variables.}

\item{group}{A character string naming the grouping variable.}
}
\value{
A list with three components:
\item{within}{Character vector of variable names that vary within ALL groups}
\item{between}{Character vector of variable names constant within ALL groups}
\item{mixed}{Character vector of variable names that vary only within SOME groups}
}
\description{
Classifies variables in the model formula as within-group, between-group,
or mixed based on their variance within groups.
}
\details{
Variables are classified based on their within-group variance:
\itemize{
\item \strong{within}: variance > 0 in ALL groups
\item \strong{between}: variance = 0 in ALL groups
\item \strong{mixed}: variance > 0 in SOME groups but not all
}
