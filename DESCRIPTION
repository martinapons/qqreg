Description: Implements the two-step quantile regression estimator from
    Pons (2026) "Quantile on Quantiles". The package estimates a two-dimensional
    quantile surface capturing heterogeneity both within and between groups.
    It performs automatic variable classification (within-group vs between-group),
    handles mixed variables, and provides clustered bootstrap inference.
    Plotting requires ggplot2 and patchwork; the optional package metR provides
    filled contour surface plots (geom_tile is used as fallback when metR is
    not installed).
